# Michael Tamaki weekly updates

## 02-27-2017

- **Past week:** Investigated blog post bug in the website project, continue 
debugging deploying cesium_web onto local computer
- **Got stuck on:** Lots of cesium_web PRs have been merged, so I am debugging
while updating
- **Coming week:** Once everything is set regarding installation, I am thinking
about making a common problems/solutions list. Other than that, I will continue
looking into the walkthrough PR.

## 03-13-2017
- **Past week:** Met with machine shop team to determine the design of the walkthrough  
Created a prototype of a walkthrough with tabs https://github.com/MichaelTamaki/walk_prototype  
- **Got stuck on:** Still need to figure out the transition between tabs for the walkthrough
- **Coming week:** I have a busy week ahead of midterms and being out of town over the weekend,
so I can't get much done. Once I am free, I will continue working out the issues with the
walkthrough.
