What did I do?
Installed docker and setup cesium-web and cesium. I just followed the READMEs.

What I am planning to do?
???

Issues:
I ended up installing docker both using brew and the mac installer from their website. It worked after using the installer. Maybe I was missing some dependency or the brew version was outdated?
